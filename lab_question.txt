16. It's not verbose at all! I really like that it's easy to see what's all
    going on, and not having to read a multi-line method to just see what it's
    about to do.
17. Honestly I don't really have any dislikes. It was pretty simple and I like
    the way that it works.
18. Yes! I understood what I was doing and got into a "rhythm" that just worked
    for me. I did enjoy this lab and it's cool how prolog works with what we
    did in this lab.
19. Probably 2 hours tops, it didn't really take me long once I sat down and got
    into a groove with it.
20. I don't really know! I know that it is sometimes used in AI, but I don't see
    myself going into that field soooo probably not.
